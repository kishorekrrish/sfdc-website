There are times when I was confused about how to parse a JSON string so that I could get the required value. Now we will see how it can be done.

##Sample JSON
```json
{
  "location_suggestions": [
    {
      "entity_type": "city",
      "entity_id": 6,
      "title": "Hyderabad",
      "latitude": 17.366,
      "longitude": 78.476,
      "city_id": 6,
      "city_name": "Hyderabad",
      "country_id": 1,
      "country_name": "India"
    }
  ],
  "status": "success",
  "has_more": 0,
  "has_total": 0
}
```
<br>
##This is easy method of all I tried
Copy the above JSON String and generate Apex using this apex generator tool.

[Json2Apex Generator](https://json2apex.herokuapp.com/){:rel="nofollow"}{:target="_blank"}

![json to apex converter](/assets/images/json-apex/json2apex.png)

paste the JSON string the space given, give a desirable name and click on the generate button. It generates two classes i.e both class and test class.

//
// Generated by JSON2Apex http://json2apex.herokuapp.com/
//
```js
public class Test {

 public List location_suggestions;
 public String status;
 public Integer has_more;
 public Integer has_total;

 public class Location_suggestions {
  public String entity_type;
  public Integer entity_id;
  public String title;
  public Double latitude;
  public Double longitude;
  public Integer city_id;
  public String city_name;
  public Integer country_id;
  public String country_name;
 }

 
 public static Test parse(String json) {
  return (Test) System.JSON.deserialize(json, Test.class);
 }
}
```
<br>
In the main class where you are making the callout, pass the JSON response obtained to the parse method in the above generated ZomatoLocation.cls apex class as follows.

```js
            reponse = res.getBody();
            ZomatoLocation jsonApex = ZomatoLocation.parse(reponse);
            
            for(ZomatoLocation.Location_suggestions loc : jsonApex.Location_suggestions){
                System.debug('location details'+loc);
                locationList.add(loc);
            }
            system.debug('locationList'+locationList);
```
<br>
and iterate through the list of type Location_suggestions (similar to a custom object in apex), add them to the list and use wherever needed.
